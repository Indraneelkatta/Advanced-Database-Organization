IMPLEMENTAIONS:

    	function 		     		Application

   	searchPage					It is used to look up the requested page in the buffer pool,
						    	Load the requested page into the BM pageHandle and return RC OK if it is found; otherwise, 
								return an error code.
	
	appendPage()				It is used to read the required page from the disk and add it to the ListPage's end.
	
	replacePage()				It is used to replace out the currently shown page for the one that was requested from the disk.
	
	FIFO()						It is Used as FIFO replacement strategy
	
	LRU()						It is Used as LRU replacement strategy
	
	CLOCK()						It is Used as CLOCK replacement strategy
	
	initPageList()				It Intializes the ListPage so that pages can be stored in the Buffer Pool.
	
	initBufferPool()			It is Used for initializing of the Buffer Pool
	
	shutdownBufferPool()		It is Used to shut down the Buffer Pool
	
	forceFlushPool()			It is Used to write the data back in the dirty pages in Buffer Pool
	
	pinPage()					It is used as a means of pinning the requested page in the buffer pool with pageNum.
								If a page cannot be located, load it from the file into the buffer pool.
	
	markDirty()					It is Used to mark the requested page as dirty page
	
	unpinPage()					It is Used to unpin a page
	
	forcePage()					It is Used to write the requested page back to the page file on the disk
	
	getFrameContents()			It is Used to return an array of PageNumbers whose size is of pageNum and for represnting the empty page frame,use the constant namely NO_PAGE
	
	getDirtyFlags()				It is Used to return an array of bools whose size of numPages and then the empty page frames are considered as clean 
	
	getFixCounts()				Returns an array of integers with a size of numPages.
	
	getNumReadIO()				It is used to indicate how many pages have been read from disk since the buffer pool was initialized.
	
	getNumWriteIO()				It is utilized to provide the number of pages that have been written to the page file since the buffer pool was initialized.
